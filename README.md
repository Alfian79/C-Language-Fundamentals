# C-Language-Fundamentals
Fundamental C programming projects and exercises from my first semester university coursework.

This repository contains my very first programming practice in the C language, based on the official university module (Module 1: Basic Programming).
This project demonstrates my ability to write and debug simple C programs, understand data types, variables, comments, and perform basic I/O operations.

## 📘 Module Summary
- ✅ Introduction to C language and its history
- ✅ IDE setup (Falcon/Dev C++)
- ✅ Syntax, variables, data types
- ✅ Input/Output with `scanf` and `printf`
- ✅ Single-line & multi-line comments
- ✅ Practice: Codelab 1 & 2 + Custom Program (Value Assessment)

  ## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Basic C programming
- Debugging & fixing syntax errors
- Input/output handling
- Using variables and format specifiers
- Writing clean, well-commented code
